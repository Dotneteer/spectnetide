With the **ZX Spectrum BASIC list** tool window, you can display the BASIC program typed or loaded into your running ZX Spectrum machine. Here you can see the program code of the **Jackpot** game while it's running:

The toolbar of the **ZX Spectrum BASIC List** window has two buttons:

- The first button allows you to export the BASIC listing.
- With the second button you can toggle between *Sinclair* and *ZX BASIC* modes.

## Export BASIC Listing

With this command, you can export the BASIC listing to a file:

By setting the **Mimic ZX BASIC** checkbox, the output will use ZX BASIC escape sequences for control characters.

## Set the display mode of BASIC 

In *Sinclair* mode, control characters (e.g., __INK__, __PAPER__, __BRIGHT__, etc.) are shown with their hexadecimal code between `Â°` characters:

However, in *ZX BASIC* mode, the control characters are displayed with their ZX BASIC escape sequences. Inline control characters (out of string values wrapped in double quotes) are omitted:
