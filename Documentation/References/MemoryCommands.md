# Memory Tool Window Commands

Right now, the memory tool window supports a simple command, __navigate__. 
When you type up to four hexadecimal digits and press __Enter__, the memory
contents scrolls down to the closest memory line with the specified address.

*In the future new memory commands will be added.*
