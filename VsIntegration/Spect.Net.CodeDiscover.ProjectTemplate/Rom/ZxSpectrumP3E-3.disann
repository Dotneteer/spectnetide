It can be shown that if 2 points X1, Y1 and X2, Y2 lie on a circle and subtend an angle N at the centre, which is also the origin of co-ordinates, then X2 = X1*COS N - Y1*SIN N, and Y2 = X1*SIN N + Y1*COS N. But because the origin is here at the increments, say Un = Xn+1 - Xn and Vn = Yn+1 - Yn, thus achieving the desired result. The stack is shown below on the (n+1)th pass through the loop, as Xn and Yn are incremented by Un and Vn, after these are obtained from Un-1 and Vn-1.

For a numerical result, the last value will be the actual floating point number. However, for a string result the last value will consist of a set of parameters. The first of the five bytes is unspecified, the second and third bytes hold the address of the start of the string and the fourth and fifth bytes hold the length of the string. When a next expression consists of only a single operand, e.g. ... A ..., ... RND ..., ... A$ (4, 3 TO 7) ... , then the last value is simply the value that is obtained from evaluating the operand. However when the next expression contains a function and an operand, e.g. ... CHR$ A..., ... NOT A ... , SIN 1 ..., the operation code of the function is stored on the machine stack until the last value of the operand has been calculated. This last value is then subjected to the appropriate operation to give a new last value. In the case of there being an arithmetic or logical operation to be performed, e.g. ... A+B ... , A*B ..., ... A=B ... , then both the last value of the first argument and the operation code have to be kept until the last value of the second argument has been found. Indeed the calculation of the last value of the second argument may also involve the storing of last values and operation codes whilst the calculation is being performed. It can therefore be shown that as a complex expression is evaluated, e.g. ... CHR$ (T+A - 26*INT ((T+A)/26)+65)..., a hierarchy of operations yet to be performed is built up until the point is reached from which it must be dismantled to produce the final last value. Each operation code has associated with it an appropriate priority code and operations of higher priority are always performed before those of lower priority.
