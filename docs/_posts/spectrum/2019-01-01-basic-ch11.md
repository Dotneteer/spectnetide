# CHAPTER 11: Random numbers

## Summary ####

- **RANDOMIZE**
- **RND**

This chapter deals with the function **RND** and the keyword **RANDOMIZE**. They are both used in connection with random numbers, so you must be careful not to get them mixed up. They are both on the same key (T); **RANDOMIZE** has had to be abbreviated to RAND.

In some ways **RND** is like a function: it does calculations and produces a result. It is unusual in that it does not need an argument.

Each time you use it, its result is a new random number between 0 and 1. (Sometimes it can take the value 0, but never 1.)

Try
 
```
10 PRINT RND
20 GO TO 10
```

to see how the answer varies. Can you detect any pattern7 You shouldn't be able to; 'random' means that there is no pattern.

Actually, **RND** is not truly random, because it follows a fixed sequence of 65536 numbers. However, these are so thoroughly jumbled up that there are at least no obvious patterns and we say that **RND** is *pseudo-random*.

**RND** gives a random number between 0 and 1, but you can easily get random numbers in other ranges. For instance, 5***RND** is between 0 and 5, and 1.3+0.7* **RND** is between 1.3 and 2. To get whole numbers, use **INT** (remembering that **INT** always rounds down) as in 1 +**INT** (RND\*6), which we shall use in a program to simulate dice. RND\*6 is in the range 0 to 6, but since it never actually reaches 6, **INT** (**RND** *6) is 0,1,2,3,4 or 5.

Here is the program:

```
10 REM dice throwing program
20 CLS
30 FOR n=1 TO 2
40 PRINT 1+1NT (RND\*6);" ";
50 NEXT n
60 INPUT a$: GO TO 20**
```

Press ENTER each time you want to throw the dice.

The **RANDOMIZE** statement is used to make **RND** start off at a definite place in its sequence of numbers, as you can see with this program:
 
```
10 RANDOMIZE 1
20 FOR n=1 TO 5: PRINT RND ,: NEXT n
30 PRINT: GO TO 10
```

After each execution of **RANDOMIZE 1**, the **RND** sequence starts off again with 0.0022735596. You can use other numbers between 1 and 65535 in the **RANDOMIZE** statement to start the **RND** sequence off at different places.

If you had a program with **RND** in it and it also had some mistakes that you had not found, then it would help to use **RANDOMIZE** like this so that the program behaved the same way each time you ran it.

**RANDOMIZE** on its own (and **RANDOMIZE 0** has the same effect) is different, because it really does randomize **RND** - you can see this in the next program.

```
10 RANDOMIZE
20 PRINT RND: GO TO 10
```

The sequence you get here is not very random, because **RANDOMIZE** uses the time since the computer was switched on. Since this has gone up by the same amount
each time **RANDOMIZE** is executed, the next RND does more or less the same. You would get better randomness by replacing **GO TO 10** by **GO TO 20**.

Note: Most dialects of BASIC use **RND** and **RANDOMIZE** to produce random numbers, but not all use them in the same way.

Here is a program to toss coins and count the numbers of heads and tails.

```
10 LET heads=0: LET tails=0
20 LET coin=lNT (RND\*2)
30 IF coin=3 THEN LET heads=heads+1
40 IF coin=1 THEN LET tails=tails+1
50 PRINT heads;",";tails,
60 IF tails\<\>6 THEN PRINT heads/tails;
70 PRINT: GO TO 20
```

The ratio of heads to tails should become approximately 1 if you go on long enough, because in the long run you expect approximately equal numbers of heads
and tails.
 
## Exercises

1. Test this rule:

Suppose you choose a number between 1 and 872 and type

**RANDOMIZE** your number

Then the next value of **RND** will be

**(75\*(your number+1) -1) /65536**

2. (For mathematicians only.)

Let *p* be a (large) prime, and let *a* be a primitive root modulo *p*.

Then if *bi* is the residue of *ai* modulo *p* (l <=*bi* <=*p*-l ), the sequence
 
![bi-1/p-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/basic/chap11diag1.gif)

is a cyclical sequence of *p*-1 distinct numbers in the range 0 to 1 (excluding 1). By choosing *a* suitably, these can be made to look fairly random.

65537 is a Fermat prime, 2l6+1. Because the multiplicative group of non-zero residues modulo 65537 has a power of 2 as its order, a residue is a primitive
root if and only if it is not a quadratic residue. Use Gauss' law of quadratic reciprocity to show that 75 is a primitive root modulo 65537.


The ZX Spectrum uses *p*=65537 and *a*=75, and stores some *bi*-l in memory. **RND** entails replacing *bi*-1 in memory by *bi+*1 -1, and yielding the result
(*bi+*1-l) (*p*-l). **RANDOMIZE** n (with 1<=n<=65535) makes *bi* equal to n+1. **RND** is approximately uniformly distributed over the range 0 to 1.
