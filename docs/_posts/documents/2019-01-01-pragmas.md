The compiler understands several pragmas that &mdash; thought they are not Z80 
instructions &mdash; they influence the emitted code. Each pragma has two alternative syntax,
one with a dot prefix and another without it. 

For example, you can write ```ORG``` or ```.ORG``` to use the __ORG__ pragma.

> I prefer using the dot-prefixed versions of pragmas.

## The ORG pragma

With the __ORG__ pragma, you define where to place the compiled Z80 code when you run it.
For example, the following line sets this location to the 0x6000 address:

```
.org #6000
```

If you do not use __ORG__, the default address is 0x8000.

You can apply multiple __ORG__ pragmas in your source code. Each usage creates a new segment in the
assembler output. Take a look at this code:

```
ld h,a
.org #8100
ld d,a
.org #8200
ld b,a
```

This code generates three output segment, each with one emitted byte that represents the 
corresponding `LD` operation. The first segment will start at 0x8000 (default), 
the second at 0x8100, whilst the third at 0x8200.

## The XORG pragma

With the __XORG__ pragma, you define the start address of a specific code section (the section started with the previous `.ORG`) to use when exporting to Intel HEX format.

For example, the following line sets this location to the 0x0000 address; however, the code section starts at 0x6000.

```
.org #6000
.xorg #0
```

If you try to use multiple `.XORG` within a code section, the assembler raises an error:

```
.org #6000
.xorg #0
    ld a,b
    ; ...
.xorg #1000 ; This line will casue an error message
```

## The ENT pragma

The __ENT__ pragma defines the entry code of the program when you run it from Visual Studio.
If you do not apply __ENT__ in your code, the entry point will be the first address of the 
very first output code segment. Here's a sample:

```
.org #6200
ld hl,#4000
.ent $
jp #6100

.org #6100
call MyCode
...
```

The `.ent $` pragma will sign the address of the `jp #6100` isntruction as the entry
address of the code. Should you omit the __ENT__ pragma from this code, the entry point would be
0x6200, for this is the start of the very first output segment, even though there is another
segment starting at 0x6100.

## The XENT pragma

The IDE provides a command, __Export Z80 Program__, which allows you to create a LOAD block
that automatically starts the code. The __Run Z80 Program__ and __Debug Z80 Program__ command
simply jump to the address you specify with the __ENT__ pragma. However, the auto LOAD block uses
the __`RANDOMIZE USR address`__ pattern where you need to define a different entry address that
can be closed with a __`RET`__ statement. The __XENT__ pragma sets this address.
 Here's a sample:

```
start: 
	.org #8000
	.ent #8000
	call SetBorder
	jp #12ac
SetBorder:
	.xent $
	ld a,4
	out (#fe),a
	ret
```

The IDE will use #8000 &mdash; according to the `.ent #8000` pragma &mdash; when starting
the code with the __Run Z80 Program__. Nonetheless, the __Export Z80 Program__ will offer #8006
&mdash; according to the `.xent $` pragma &mdash; as the startup code address.

## The DISP pragma

The __DISP__ pragma allows you to define a displacement for the code. The value affects the
`$` token that represents the current assembly address. Your code is placed according 
to the __ORG__ of the particular output segment, but the assembly address is always displaced
with the value according to __DISP__. Take a look at this sample:

```
.org #6000
.disp #1000
ld hl,$
```

The `ld hl,$` instruction will be placed to the 0x6000 address, but it will be equivalent
with the `ld hl,#7000` statement due to the `.disp #1000` displacement.

> Of course, you can use negative displacement, too.

## The BANK pragma

The ZX Spectrum 128K/2A/+2A/+3/+3E models handle 16K memory pages (banks) that can be paged into particular memory slots.
(You can find more information about this [here](https://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/128kreference.htm).)

The __BANK__ pragma allows you to declare that you want to put the Z80 Assembly code in a specific memory bank.
When you export the compiled output, the __Export program__ function of __SpectNetIDE__ creates a loader that reads the 
code and places it on the specified memory page.

The __BANK__ pragma accepts two parameters. The first is the bank number (so it must be between 0 and 7). The second one is
an optional offset value (between 0 and 16383), which indicates the start offset within the bank. If you omit this, the default
value is zero. By default, the SpectNetIDE assembler assumes that the start address of the code in the bank is `$C000`. Nonetheless,
you can specify any other value.

> __Note__: You need to apply the `.model Spectrum128` pragma at the top of your code so that you can use `.bank`.

### Using BANK without an offset

Let's assume you have this code:

```
.model Spectrum128
; ...
.bank 3
  call yellow
  ret
yellow:
  ld a,6
  out (#fe),a
  ret
```

The compiler emits this code (and later, the loader takes care that it goes to bank #3):

```
0000: call #C004  ; yellow
0003: ret
0004: ld a,#06    ; this is yellow (#C004)
0006: out (#FE),a
```

The offset values at the beginning of the lines show the byte offset within the 16K memory bank.

### Using BANK with an offset

Let's modify the previous code adding an offset value:

```
.model Spectrum128
; ...
.bank 3, #100
  call yellow
  ret
yellow:
  ld a,6
  out (#fe),a
  ret
```

Now, the compiler emits similar code, but its starts address is #C100 (#100 away from the default #C000):

```
0100: call #C104  ; yellow
0103: ret
0104: ld a,#06    ; this is yellow (#C104)
0106: out (#FE),a
```

Though it seems that we're wasting the first 256 bytes of the page, the __Export program__ command does not output
those bytes. The loader knows that it should load the code from address #C100.

### Using BANK with ORG

Though the default address to compile the code is #C000, you can change it. For example, Bank #2 is paged into the #8000-#BFFF
memory range (slot 2), so it seems natural to use the #8000 address like this:

```
.model Spectrum128
; ...
.bank 2
.org #8000
  call yellow
  ret
yellow:
  ld a,6
  out (#fe),a
  ret
```

As you expect, this is the output:

```
0000: call #8004  ; yellow
0003: ret
0004: ld a,#06    ; this is yellow (#8004)
0006: out (#FE),a
```

### Using BANK with offset, and ORG

You can combine the offset of the bank with ORG:

```
.bank 2, #100
.org #8000
  call yellow
  ret
yellow:
  ld a,6
  out (#fe),a
  ret
```

The output is probably different from the one you expect:

```
0100: call #8004  ; yellow
0103: ret
0104: ld a,#06    ; this is yellow (#8004)
0106: out (#FE),a
```

As you can see, the code stream is the same as in the previous case; however, here, the code starts at offset #100.

### Using multiple BANK directives

As you may need multiple memory banks in your program, you can use multiple `BANK` pragmas, like in this example:

```
.bank 1
; Here goes the code for bank #1
; ...
.bank 3
; Here goes the code for bank #3
; ...
```

### Restrictions with BANK

- `BANK` cannot have a label.
- `BANK` cannot be used with the ZX Spectrum 48 model type.
- The `BANK` value must be between 0 and 7
- The offset must be between 0 and 16383
- You can use the `BANK` pragma for a particular bank page only once, so, for example, the following code raises
an error message:

```
.bank 1
; ...

.bank 3
; ...

.bank 1 ; This line raises the error
; ...
```

> __Note__: This is a temporary restriction. In the future, it may be removed.



## The EQU pragma

The __EQU__ pragma allows you assign a value to an identifier. The label before __EQU__ is the
name of the identifier (or symbol), the exression used in __EQU__ is the value of the variable.
This is a short sample:

```
      .org #6200
      ld hl,Sym1
Sym1: .equ #4000
      ld bc,Sym2
Sym2: .equ $+4
```

This sample is equivalent with this one:

```
.org #6200
ld hl,#4000 ; Sym1 <-- #4000
ld bc,#620a ; Sym2 <-- #620a as an ld bc,NNNN operation and
                       an ld hl,NNNN each takes 3 bytes
```

## The VAR pragma

The __VAR__ pragma works similarly to __EQU__. However, while __EQU__ does not allow using the same symbol
with mulitple value assignments, __VAR__ assigns a new value to the symbol every time it is used.

> The VAR pragma accepts extra syntax alternatives: `=`, `:=`

## The DEFB pragma

The __DEFB__ pragma emits 8-bit expressions (bytes) from the current assembly position.
here is a sample:

```
.org #6000
.defb #01, #02, $, #04
```

The __DEFB__ pragma will emit these four bytes starting at 0x6000: 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04.
The `$` expression will emit 0x03, because at the emission point the current assembly
address is 0x6003. The __DEFB__ program takes into account only the rightmost 8 bits of any
expression: this is how `$` results in 0x03.

> __DEFB__ has extra syntax variants: `db`, `.db`, `DB`, and `.DB` are accepted, too.

## The DEFW pragma

The __DEFW__ pragma is similar to __DEFB__, but it emits 16-bit values with LSB, MSB order.

```
.defw #1234, #abcd
```

This simple code above will emit these four bytes: 0x34, 0x12, 0xcd, 0xab.

> __DEFW__ has extra syntax variants: `dw`, `.dw`, `DW`, and `.DW` are accepted, too.

## The DEFM pragma

The __DEFM__ pragma emits the byte-array representation of a string. Each character
in the string is replaced with the correcponding byte. Take a look at this code:

```
.defm "\C by me"
```

Here, the __DEFM__ pragma emits 7 bytes for the seven characters (the first escape 
sequence represents the copyrigh sign) : 0x7f, 0x20, 0x62, 0x69, 0x20, 0x6d, 0x65.

> __DEFM__ has extra syntax variants: `dm`, `.dm`, `DM`, and `.DM` are accepted, too.

## The DEFN pragma

The __DEFN__ pragma works just like the `DEFM` pragma but it emits an additional `0x00`
byte to terminate the string. Look at this code:

```
.defn "\C by me"
```

Here, the __DEFN__ pragma emits 8 bytes for the seven characters (the first escape 
sequence represents the copyrigh sign) plus the terminating zero:
0x7f, 0x20, 0x62, 0x69, 0x20, 0x6d, 0x65, 0x00.

> __DEFN__ has extra syntax variants: `dn`, `.dn`, `DN`, and `.DN` are also accepted.

## The DEFC pragma

The __DEFC__ pragma works just like the `DEFM` pragma but it sets Bit 7 of the last 
emitted character. Look at this code:

```
.defc "\C by me"
```

Here, the __DEFC__ pragma emits 7 bytes for the seven characters (the first escape 
sequence represents the copyrigh sign) with Bit 7 of the last character (0x65) set (so it become 0xE5):
0x7f, 0x20, 0x62, 0x69, 0x20, 0x6d, 0xE5.

> __DEFC__ has extra syntax variants: `dc`, `.dc`, `DC`, and `.DC` are also accepted.

## The DEFH pragma

The __DEFH__ pragma uses a string with even number of hexadecimal digits to emits a 
byte-array representation of the input. Each character pair in the string is replaced
with the correcponding byte. Take a look at this code:

```
.defh "12E4afD2"
```

Here, the __DEFH__ pragma emits 4 bytes: 0x12, 0xe4, 0xaf, 0xd2.

> __DEFH__ has extra aliases: `dh`, `.dh`, `DH`, and `.DH`.


## The DEFS pragma

You can emit zero (`0x00`) bytes with this pragma. It accepts a single argument,
the number of zeros to emit. This code sends 16 zeros to the generated output:

```
.defs 16
```

> __DEFS__ has extra syntax variants: `ds`, `.ds`, `DS`, and `.DS` are also accepted.

## The FILLB pragma

With __FILLB__, you can emit a particular count of a specific byte. The first argument
of the pragma sets the count, the second specifies the byte to emit. This code emits 24
bytes of `#A5` values:
```
.fillb 24,#a5
```

## The FILLW pragma

With __FILLW__, you can emit a particular count of a specific 16-bit word. The first argument
of the pragma sets the count, the second specifies the word to emit. This code emits 8
words (16 bytes) of `#12A5` values:
```
.fillw 8,#12a5
```

Of course, the bytes of a word are emitted in LSB/MSB order.


## The SKIP pragma

The __SKIP__ pragma &mdash; as its name suggests &mdash; skips the number of bytes
as specified in its argument. It fills up the skipped bytes with 0xFF.

## The EXTERN pragma

The __EXTERN__ pragma is kept for future extension. The current compiler accepts it, but
does not do any action when observing this pragma.

## The MODEL pragma

This pragma is used when you run or debug your Z80 code within the emulator. With Spectrum 128K, Spectrum +3, 
and Spectrum Next models, you can run the Z80 code in differend contexts. The __MODEL__ pragma lets you
specify on which model you want to run the code. You can use the `SPECTRUM48`, `SPECTRUM128`, 
`SPECTRUMP3`, or `NEXT` identifiers to choose the model (identifiers are case-insensitive):

```
.model Spectrum48
.model Spectrum128
.model SpectrumP3
.model Next
```

For example, when you create code for Spectrum 128K, and add the `.model Spectrum48` pragma to the code,
the __Run Z80 Code__ command will start the virtual machine, turns the machine into Spectrum 48K mode, and ignites
the code just after that.

_Note_: With the `#ifmod` and `#ifnmod` directives, you can check the model type. For example, the following
Z80 code results green background on Spectrum 48K, cyan an Spectrum 128K:

```
    .model Spectrum48

#ifmod Spectrum128
    BorderColor: .equ 5
    RetAddr: .equ #2604
#else
    BorderColor: .equ 4
    RetAddr: .equ #12a2
#endif

Start:
    .org #8000
    ld a,BorderColor
    out (#fe),a
    jp RetAddr
```

## The ALIGN pragma

This pragma allows you to align the current assembly counter to the specified byte boundary. 
You can use this pragma with an optional expression. Look at these samples:

```
.org #8000
    nop
.align 4
    nop
.align
```

The first pragma aligns the assembly counter to #8004, as this one is the next 4-byte boundary.
With no value specified, `.align` uses #100, and thus the second `.align` in the sample sets
the current assembly counter to the next page boundary, #8100.

## The TRACE and TRACEHEX pragmas

These pragmas send trace information to the assembler output. In the Visual Studio IDE, these
messages are displayed in the Z80 Build Output window pane. You can list one or more expressions 
separated by a comma after the `.trace` token. TRACEHEX works just like TRACE, but id displays 
integer numbers and strings in hexadecimal format.

Let'assume, you add these lines to the source code:

```
.trace "Hello, this is: ", 42
.tracehex "Hello, this is: ", 42
```

When you compile the source, the lines above display these messages:

```
TRACE: Hello, this is: 42
TRACE: 48656C6C6F2C20746869732069733A20002A
```

## The RNDSEED pragma

With the `rnd()` function, you can generate random numbers. The RNDSEED pragma sets the seed
value to use for random number generation. If you use this pragma with an integer expression,
the seed is set to tha value of that expression. If you do not provide the expression, the compiler
uses the system clock to set up the seed.

```
.rndseed ; sets the seed according to the system clock
.rndseed 123 ; sets the seed to 123
```

## The DEFGX pragma

This pragma helps you define bitmaps in the code. This pragma excepts a string expression 
and utilizes that string as a pattern to generate bytes for the bitmap.

> __DEFGX__ has extra syntax variants: `dgx`, `.dgx`, `DGX`, and `.DGX` are accepted, too.

If the very first character of the string pattern is `<`, the pattern is left aligned, 
and starts with the second character. Should the first character be `>`, the pattern is 
right aligned and starts with the second character. By default, (if no `<` or `>` is used)
the pattern is left-aligned.

Any space within the pattern are ignored, taken into account as helpers. Other characters
are converted into bits one-by-one.

Before the conversion, the pragma checks if the pattern constitutes multiples of 8 bits.
If not, it uses zero bit prefixes (right-aligned), or zero-bit suffixes (left-aligned)
so that the pattern would be adjusted to contain entire bytes.

The `.` (dot), `-` (dash), and `_` (underscore) sign 0, any other characters stand for 1. 
Every 8 bits in the pattern emit a byte.

Here are a few samples:

```
.dg "....OOOO"         ; #0F
.dg ">....OOOO"        ; #0F
.dg "<----OOOO"        ; #0F
.dg "___OOOO"          ; #1E
.dg "....OOOO ..OO"    ; #0F, #30
.dg ">....OO OO..OOOO" ; #03, #CF
```

## The DEFG pragma

This pragma helps you define bitmaps in the code. This pragma excepts a string pattern (_note: not a string expression!_) 
and utilizes that string as a pattern to generate bytes for the bitmap.

> __DEFG__ has extra syntax variants: `dg`, `.dg`, `DG`, and `.DG` are also accepted.

Any space within the pattern are ignored, taken into account as helpers. Other characters
are converted into bits one-by-one. The pixels in a byte are planted with the LHS as the 
most-significant bit, and multiple bytes are planted LHS byte first.

The `.` (dot), `-` (dash), and `_` (underscore) sign 0, any other characters stand for 1. 
Every 8 bits in the pattern emit a byte.

Here are a few samples:

```
.dg ....OOOO        ; #0F
.dg ___OOOO         ; #1E
.dg ....OOOO ..OO"  ; #0F, #30
.dg ....OO OO..OOOO ; #0F, #3C
```

> Please note, unlinke in the pattern used with `DEFGX`, here, the leading `>` and `<` characters 
> are taken as bit 1. They do not specify bit alignment.

## The ERROR Pragma

You can raise custom error messages with this pragma. __ERROR__ accepts an expression
and displays an error message with code `Z0500` using the text you provide. Here is a sample:

```
.error "The value must be greater than" + str(minvalue)
```

## The INCLUDEBIN Pragma

You can include a binary file into the source code to emit all bytes just as if you used the 
`.defb` pragma. You can include the entire file, or a single segment of it. The pragma has a 
mandatory argument &mdash; the name of the binary file to include &mdash; and two optional 
ones, the start offset of the segment, and its length, respectively. Let's see a few examples:

```
.includebin "./myfile.bin"
.includebin "./myfile.bin" 2
.includebin "./myfile.bin" 2, 3
```

This snippet loads the `myfile.bin` file from the same directory that contains the source 
with the `.includebin` directive.

Let's assume that `myfile.bin` contains these bytes:

```
#00, #01, #02, #03, #04, #05, #06, #07 
```

The three lines of code above are the same as if we had written these code lines:

```
.defb #00, #01, #02, #03, #04, #05, #06, #07 ; .includebin "./myfile.bin"
.defb #02, #03, #04, #05, #06, #07           ; .includebin "./myfile.bin" 2
.defb #02, #03, #04                          ; .includebin "./myfile.bin" 2, 3
```

> Of course, the compiler does not allow negative file offset or length. It alse raises
> an error if you define a segment that does not fit into the binary file.  
> You can use alternative syntax for `.includebin`. The compiler accepts these tokens and their
> uppercase versions, too: `includebin`, `.include_bin`, and `include_bin`.

## The COMPAREBIN pragma

When you are re-engineering a Z80 program from an exported disassembly, it is good to know that you do not break the original code. The `.comparebin` pragma helps you to check that you still compile what you expect. It loads a binary file and compares that file with the output of the current code segment.

The pragma has a mandatory argument &mdash; the name of the binary file to include &mdash; and two optional ones, the start offset of the segment, and its length, respectively. Let's see a few examples:

```
.comparebin "./myfile.bin"
.comparebin "./myfile.bin" 2
.comparebin "./myfile.bin" 2, 3
```

> Of course, the compiler does not allow negative file offset or length. It also raises an error if you define a segment that does not fit into the binary file.  
> You can use alternative syntax for `.comparebin`. The compiler accepts these tokens, too: `comparebin`, `.COMPAREBIN`, and `COMPAREBIN`.

When you compile the code, every `.org` pragma opens a new segment that starts from the point defined by `.org`.

You can put it into the code in as many places as you want. As the compiler parses the code, it records the positions of `.comparebin` pragmas, the current output segment and its length at the point where `.comparebin` is used. When the code compilation is ready &mdash; and there are no errors &mdash;, the compiler executes a check.
This check compares the emitted bytes with the recorded length to the bytes in the binary file.

- If the length of the segment is greater than the size of the file, the compiler raises an error.
- The comparison checks only the as many bytes as are in the output segment; if there are more bytes in the binary file, the remaining data is ignored.
- If the compared data do not match, the assembler raises an error with the first unmatching position.

Let's assume, we have the `origin.bin` file that contains these six bytes:

```
#00, #01, #02, #03, #04, #05
```

Take a look at this code:

```
  .org #8000
  .defb #00, #01, #02
  .comparebin "origin.bin"

  .org #8100
  .defb #03, #04, #05
  .comparebin "origin.bin"
  .comparebin "origin.bin", 3
```

This code contains two segments (it has two `.org` pragmas) and three `.comparebin`.

- Though `origin.bin` has six bytes, the first comparison succeeds, as it utilizes only the three bytes emitted in the first segment.
- The second comparison fails, as the file starts with #00, #01, #02, while the segment emits #03, #04, and #05.
- The third comparison succeeds, as it starts the examination from the 4th byte (offset 3) of the binary file.
