# CHAPTER 15: More about **PRINT** and **INPUT**

## Summary

- **CLS**
- **PRINT** items: nothing at all
- **Expressions** (numeric or string type): **TAB** numeric expression, **AT** numeric expression, numeric expression**
- **PRINT** separators: , ; '
- **INPUT items: variables (numeric or string type)**
- **LINE** string variable
- Any **PRINT** item not beginning with a letter. (Tokens are not considered as beginning with a letter.)**
- Scrolling
- **SCREEN$**

You have already seen **PRINT** used quite a lot, so you will have a rough idea of how it is used. Expressions whose values are printed are called **PRINT** *items*, and they are separated by commas or semicolons, which are called **PRINT** *separators*. A **PRINT** item can also be nothing at all, which is a way of
explaining what happens when you use two commas in a row.

There are two more kinds of **PRINT** items, which are used to tell the computer not what, but where to print. For example **PRINT AT 11,16;"\*"** prints a star in the middle of the screen.

**AT line, column**

moves the **PRINT** position (the place where the next item is to be printed) to the line and column specified. Lines are numbered from 0 (at the top) to 21, and
columns from 0 (on the left) to 31.

SCREEN$ is the reverse function to **PRINT AT**, and will tell you (within limits) what character is at a particular position on the screen. It uses line and
column numbers in the same way as **PRINT AT**, but enclosed in brackets: for instance

**PRINT SCREEN$ (11,16)**

will retrieve the star you printed in the paragraph above.

Characters taken from tokens print normally, as single characters, and spaces return as spaces. Lines drawn by **PLOT**, **DRAW** or **CIRCLE**, user-defined characters and graphics characters return as a null (empty) string, however. The same applies if **OVER** has been used to create a composite character.

**TAB column**

prints enough spaces to move the **PRINT** position to the column specified. It stays on the same line. or, if this would involve backspacing, moves on to the
next one. Note that the computer reduces the column number 'modulo 32' (it divides by 32 and takes the remainder); so **TAB** 33 means the same as **TAB** 1.

As an example,

**PRINT TAB 30;1;TAB 12;"Contents"; AT 3,1;"CHAPTER";TAB 24;"page"**

is how you might print out the heading of a contents page on page 1 of a book.

Try running this:

```
10 FOR n=8 TO 23
20 PRINT TAB 8\*n;n;
30 NEXT n
```

This shows what is meant by the **TAB** numbers being reduced modulo 32.

For a more elegant example, change the 8 in line 20 to a 6.

Some small points:
 
_(i)_: These new items are best terminated with semicolons, as we have done above. You can use commas (or nothing, at the end of the statement), but this means
that after having carefully set up the **PRINT** position you immediately move it on again not usually terribly useful.

_(ii)_: You cannot print on the bottom two lines (22 and 23) on the screen because they are reserved for commands, **INPUT** data, reports and so on. References to 'the bottom line' usually mean line 21.

_(iii)_: You can use **AT** to put the **PRINT** position even where there is alreadysomething printed; the old stuff will be obliterated when you print more.

Another statement connected with **PRINT** is **CLS**. This clears the whole screen, something that is also done by **CLEAR** and **RUN**.

When the printing reaches the bottom of the screen, it starts to scroll upwards rather like a typewriter. You can see this if you do

```
CLS: FOR n=1 TO 22: PRINT n: NEXT n
```
and then do

```
PRINT 99
```

a few times.

If the computer is printing out reams and reams of stuff, then it takes great care to make sure that nothing is scrolled off the top of the screen until you
have had a chance to look at it properly. You can see this happening if you type

**CLS: FOR n=1 TO 100: PRINT n: NEXT n**

When it has printed a screen full, it will stop, writing **scroll?** at the bottom of the screen. You can now inspect the first 22 numbers at your leisure.
When you have finished with them, press y (for 'yes') and the computer will give you another screen full of numbers. Actually, any key will make the computer
carry on except n (for 'no'), STOP (**SYMBOL SHIFT** and a), or SPACE (the BREAK key). These will make the computer stop running the program with a report **D
BREAK - CONT repeats**.

The **INPUT** statement can do much more than we have told you so far. You have already seen **INPUT** statements like

**INPUT "How old are you?", age**

in which the computer prints the caption How old are you? at the bottom of the screen, and then you have to type in your age.

In fact, an **INPUT** statement is made up of items and separators in exactly the same way as a **PRINT** statement is, so How old are you? and age are both **INPUT** items. **INPUT** items are generally the same as **PRINT** items, but there are some very important differences.

First, an obvious extra **INPUT** item is the variable whose value you are to type in age in our example above. The rule is that if an **INPUT** item begins with a letter, it must be a variable whose value is to be input.

Second, this would seem to mean that you can't print out the values of variables as part of a caption; however, you can get round this by putting brackets round
the variable. Any expression that starts with a letter must be enclosed in brackets if it is to be printed as part of a caption.

Any kind of **PRINT** item that is not affected by these rules is also an **INPUT** item. Here is an example to illustrate what's going on:

**LET my age = **INT** (RND \* 100): INPUT ("I am ";my age; ". ");"How old are you?", your age**

*my age* is contained in brackets, so its value gets printed out. *your age* is not contained in brackets, so you have to type its value in.

Everything that an **INPUT** statement writes goes to the bottom part of the screen, which acts somewhat independently of the top half. In particular, its lines are numbered relative to the top line of the bottom half, even if this has moved up the actual television screen (which it does if you type lots and lots of **INPUT** data).
 
To see how **AT** works in **INPUT** statements, try running this:

**10 INPUT "This is line 1.",a$; AT 0,0;"This is line 0.",a$; AT 2,0;**

**"This is line 2.",a$; AT 1,0; "This is still line 1.",a$**

(just press ENTER each time it stops.) When This is line 2. is printed, the lower part of the screen moves up to make room for it; but the numbering moves
up as well, so that the lines of text keep their same numbers.

Now try this:
 
```
10 FOR n=0 TO 19: PRINT AT n,0;n;: NEXT n

20 **INPUT** AT 0,0;a$; AT 1,0;a$; AT 2,0;a$; AT 3,0;a$; AT 4,0;a$; AT
5,0;a$;
```

As the lower part of the screen goes up and up, the upper part is undisturbed until the lower part threatens to write on the same line as the **PRINT** position.
Then the upper part starts scrolling up to avoid this.

Another refinement to the INPUT statement that we haven't seen yet is called LINE input and is a different way of inputting string variables. If you write
LINE before the name of a string variable to be input, as in

**INPUT LINE a$**

then the computer will not give you the string quotes that it normally does for a string variable, although it will pretend to itself that they are there. So if
you type in

**cat**

as the **INPUT** data, a$ will be given the value cat. Because the string quotes do not appear on the string, you cannot delete them and type in a different sort of string expression for the **INPUT** data. Remember that you cannot use LINE for numeric variables.

The control characters **CHR$** Z and **CHR$** 23 have effects rather like **AT** and **TAB**. They are rather odd as control characters, because whenever one is sent to the television to be printed, it must be followed by two more characters that do not have their usual effect: they are treated as numbers (their codes) to specify the line and column (for **AT**) or the tab position (for **TAB**). You will almost always find it easier to use **AT** and **TAB** in the usual way rather than the control characters, but they might be useful in some circumstances. The **AT** control character is **CHR$** 22. The first character after it specifies the line number and the second the column number, so that

**PRINT CHR$ 22+CHR$ 1 +CHR$ c;**

has exactly the same effect as

**PRINT AT 1,c;**

This is so even if **CHR$** 1 or **CHR$** c would normally have a different meaning (for instance if c=13); the **CHR$** 22 before them overrides that.

The **TAB** control character is **CHR$** 23 and the two characters after it are used to give a number between 0 and 65535 specifying the number you would have in a **TAB** item:

**PRINT CHRS 23+CHRS a+CHRS b;**

has the same effect as

**PRINT TAB a+256\*b;**

You can use **POKE** to stop the computer asking you **scroll?** by doing

**POKE 23692,255**

every so often. After this it will scroll up 255 times before stopping with **scroll?**. As an example, try

```
10 FOR n=0 TO 10000
20 PRINT n: POKE 23692,255
30 NEXT n
```

and watch everything whizz off the screen!

## Exercises

1. Try this program on some children, to test their multiplication tables.

```
10 LET m$=" "
20 LET a=INT (RND*12)+1: LET b=lNT (RND*12)+1
30 INPUT (m$) ' ' "what is ";(a) ";(b);"?";c
100 IF c=a-b THEN LET m$="Right.": GO TO 20
110 LET m$=''Wrong. Try again.": GO TO 30
```
 
If they are perceptive, they might manage to work out that they do not have to do the calculation themselves. For instance, if the computer asks them to type
the answer to 2\*3, all they have to type in is 2\*3.

One way of getting round this is to make them input strings instead of numbers. Replace c in line 30 by c$. and in line 100 by **VAL** c$, and insert a line

```
40 IF c$ <> STR$ **VAL** c$ THEN LET m$="Type it properly, as a number,":GO TO 30
```

That will fool them. After a few more days, however, one of them may discover that they can get round this by rubbing out the string quotes and typing in
**STR$** (2\*3). To stop up this loophole, you can replace c$ in line 30 by LINE c$.
