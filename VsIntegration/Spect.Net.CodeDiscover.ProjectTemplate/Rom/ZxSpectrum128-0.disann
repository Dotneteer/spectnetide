If the time from turning the volume off for the current note to the time to turn the volume on for the next note is short enough, then it will not be noticeable. However, the code at $1066 (ROM 0) introduces a 1/96th of a note delay and as a result a 1/96th of a note period of silence between notes. The bug can be resolved by simply deleting the two instructions below that introduce the delay. A positive side effect of the bug in the 'V' volume command at $0C95 (ROM 0) is that it can be used to overcome the gaps of silence between notes for sound chip channels. By interspersing volume commands between notes, a new volume level is immediately set before the 1/96th of a note delay is introduced for the new note. Therefore, the delay occurs when the new note is audible instead of when it is silent. For example, PLAY \"cV15cV15c\" instead of PLAY \"ccc\". The note durations are still 1/96th of a note longer than they should be though. This technique will only work on the sound chip channels and not for any MIDI channels.

The bug occurs due to the leading spaces or zeros, and hence will apply to every BASIC command. When the line is inserted into the Screen Line Edit Buffer, the leading spaces are discarded and hence the line length is shorter than that typed in. However, it is the typed in line length that is used when parsing the BASIC line in the Screen Line Edit Buffer and as a result this causes an attempt to find the remaining characters on the following row of the Screen Line Edit Buffer. If another BASIC line is on the following Screen Line Edit Buffer row then the search completes and the cursor is placed on the row after this BASIC line. If there is not a BASIC line on the following row then the search continues on the next row. Since this will also be empty, the search advances onto the next row, and then the next, and so on until row 20 is reached. To fix the bug, the typed in character count until the cursor (held in $EC06) ideally needs to be adjusted to match the actual number of characters stored in the Screen Line Edit Buffer. However, this is not a trivial change to implement. A simpler solution to fix the bug is to intercept when a move to the next row is made and to determine whether the BASIC line actually continues on this row. Credit: Paul Farrow]",
