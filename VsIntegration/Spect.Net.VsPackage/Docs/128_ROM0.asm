; -------
; Markers
; -------
; The following markers appear throughout the disassembly:
;
; [...] = Indicates a comment about the code.
; ????  = Information to be determined.
;
; For bugs, the following marker format is used:
;
; [*BUG* - xxxx. Credit: yyyy]  = Indicates a confirmed bug, with a description 'xxxx' of it and the discoverer 'yyyy'.
; [*BUG*? - xxxx. Credit: yyyy] = Indicates a suspected bug, with a description 'xxxx' of it and the discoverer 'yyyy'.
;
; Since many of the Spectrum 128 ROM routines were re-used in the Spectrum +2 and +3, where a bug was originally identified
; in the Spectrum +2 or +3 the discoverer is acknowledged along with who located the corresponding bug in the Spectrum 128.
;
; For every bug identified, an example fix is provided and the author acknowledged. Some of these fixes can be made directly within the routines
; affected since they do not increase the length of those routines. Others require the insertion of extra instructions and hence these cannot be
; completely fitted within the routines affected. Instead a jump must be made to a patch routine located within a spare area of the ROM.
; Fortunately there is 0.5K of unused routines located at $2336-$2536 (ROM 0) which are remnants of the original Spanish 128, and another unused routine
; located at $3FC3-$3FCE (ROM 0). This is sufficient space to implement all of the bug fixes suggested.

; ==============================

; ==========================
; 128 BASIC Mode Limitations
; ==========================
; There are a number of limitations when using 128 BASIC mode, some of which are not present when using the equivalent 48 BASIC mode operations.
; These are more design decisions than bugs.
;
; - The RAM disk VERIFY command does not verify but simply performs a LOAD.
; - The renumber facility will not renumber line numbers that are defined as an expression, e.g. GO TO VAL "10".
; - The printer output routine cannot handle binary data and hence EPSON printer ESC codes cannot be sent.
; - The Editor has the following limitations:
;   - Variables cannot have the same name as a keyword. This only applies when entering a program and not when one is loaded in.
;   - Line number 0 is not supported and will not list properly. It is not possible to directly insert such a line, not even in 48 BASIC mode,
;     and so line number 0 is not officially supported.
;   - There is a practical limitation on the size of lines that can be entered. It is limited to 20 indented rows, which is the size of the editing buffers.
;     Typed lines greater than 20 rows get inserted into the BASIC program, but only the first 20 rows are shown on screen. Editing such a line causes
;     it to be truncated to 20 rows. There is no warning when the 20 row limit is exceeded.
;   - It is not possible to directly enter embedded control codes, or to correctly edit loaded in programs that contain them. Loaded programs that
;     contain them will run correctly so long as the lines are not edited.
;   - It is not possible to embed the string of characters ">=", "<=" or "<>" into a string or REM statement without them being tokenized
;     (this is perhaps more an oversight than a design decision).
;   - In 48 BASIC mode if the line '10 REM abc: PRINT xyz' is typed then the word PRINT is stored as a new keyword since the colon (arguably incorrectly)
;     reverts to 'K' mode. In 128 BASIC mode, typing the same line stores each letter as a separate character.


; ==================
; Timing Information
; ==================
; Clock Speed   = 3.54690 MHz (48K Spectrum clock speed was 3.50000 MHz)
; Scan line     = 228 T-states (48K Spectrum was 224 T-states).
; TV scan lines = 311 total, 63 above picture (48K Spectrum had 312 total, 64 above picture).


; ===========
; I/O Details
; ===========

; -------------
; Memory Paging
; -------------
; Memory paging is controlled by I/O port:
; $7FFD (Out) - Bits 0-2: RAM bank (0-7) to page into memory map at $C000.
;               Bit 3   : 0=SCREEN 0 (normal display file in bank 5), 1=SCREEN 1 (shadow display file in bank 7).
;               Bit 4   : 0=ROM 0 (128K Editor), 1=ROM 1 (48K BASIC).
;               Bit 5   : 1=Disable further output to this port until a hard reset occurs.
;               Bit 6-7 : Not used (always write 0).
;
; The Editor ROM (ROM 0) always places a copy of the last value written to port $7FFD
; into new system variable BANK_M ($5B5C).
;
; ----------
; Memory Map
; ----------
; ROM 0 or 1 resides at $0000-$3FFF.
; RAM bank 5 resides at $4000-$7FFF always.
; RAM bank 2 resides at $8000-$BFFF always.
; Any RAM bank may reside at $C000-$FFFF.
;
; -------------------
; Shadow Display File
; -------------------
; The shadow screen may be active even when not paged into the memory map.
;
; ----------------
; Contended Memory
; ----------------
; Physical RAM banks 1, 3, 5 and 7 are contended with the ULA.
;
; -----------------
; Logical RAM Banks
; -----------------
; Throughout ROM 0, memory banks are accessed using a logical numbering scheme, which
; maps to physical RAM banks as follows:
;
; Logical Bank   Physical Bank
; ------------   -------------
;     $00             $01
;     $01             $03
;     $02             $04
;     $03             $06
;     $04             $07
;     $05             $00
;
; This scheme makes the RAM disk code simpler than having to deal directly with physical RAM bank numbers.

; -------------------------
; AY-3-8912 Sound Generator
; -------------------------
; The AY-3-8912 sound generator is controlled by two I/O ports:
; $FFFD (Out)    - Select a register 0-14.
; $FFFD (In)     - Read from the selected register.
; $BFFD (In/Out) - Write to the selected register. The status of the register can also be read back.
;
; The AY-3-8912 I/O port A is used to drive the RS232 and Keypad sockets.
;

; Error Report Codes
; ==================

; ---------------------------
; Standard Error Report Codes
; ---------------------------
; See the end of this document for descriptions of the standard error report codes.

; ----------------------
; New Error Report Codes
; ----------------------
; a - MERGE error                      MERGE! would not execute for some reason - either size or file type wrong.
; b - Wrong file type                  A file of an inappropriate type was specified during RAM disk operation, for instance a CODE file in LOAD!"name".
; c - CODE error                       The size of the file would lead to an overrun of the top of memory.
; d - Too many brackets                Too many brackets around a repeated phrase in one of the arguments.
; e - File already exists              The file name specified has already been used.
; f - Invalid name                     The file name specified is empty or above 10 characters in length.
; g - File does not exist              [Never used by the ROM].
; h - File does not exist              The specified file could not be found.
; i - Invalid device                   The device name following the FORMAT command does not exist or correspond to a physical device.
; j - Invalid baud rate                The baud rate for the RS232 was set to 0.
; k - Invalid note name                PLAY came across a note or command it didn't recognise, or a command which was in lower case.
; l - Number too big                   A parameter for a command is an order of magnitude too big.
; m - Note out of range                A series of sharps or flats has taken a note beyond the range of the sound chip.
; n - Out of range                     A parameter for a command is too big or too small. If the error is very large, error L results.
; o - Too many tied notes              An attempt was made to tie too many notes together.
; p - (c) 1986 Sinclair Research Ltd   This error is given when too many PLAY channel strings are specified. Up to 8 PLAY channel strings are supported
;                                      by MIDI devices such as synthesisers, drum machines or sequencers. Note that a PLAY command with more than 8 strings
;                                      cannot be entered directly from the Editor. The Spanish 128 produces "p Bad parameter" for this error. It could be
;                                      that the intention was to save memory by using the existing error message of "Q Parameter error" but the change of report
;                                      code byte was overlooked.

;   Bytes $10-$12: End address of file in RAM disk area (used as current position indicator when loading/saving).
;   Byte  $13    : Flags:
;                     Bit 0   : 1=Entry requires updating.
;                     Bits 1-7: Not used (always hold 0).
;
; The catalogue can store up to 562 entries, and hence the RAM disk can never hold more than 562 files no matter
; how small the files themselves are. Note that filenames are case sensitive.
;
; The shadow screen (SCREEN 1) also resides in physical RAM bank 7 and so if more than 217 catalogue
; entries are created then SCREEN 1 will become corrupted [Credit: Toni Baker, ZX Computing Monthly].
; However, since screen 1 cannot be used from BASIC, it may have been a design decision to allow the
; RAM disk to overwrite it.
;
; The actual files are stored in physical RAM banks 1, 3, 4 and 6 (logical banks 0, 1, 2, 3),
; starting from $C000 in physical RAM bank 1 and growing upwards.
;
; A file consists of a 9 byte header followed by the data for the file. The header bytes
; have the following meaning:
;   Byte  $00    : File type - $00=Program, $01=Numeric array, $02=Character array, $03=Code/Screen$.
;   Bytes $01-$02: Length of program/code block/screen$/array ($1B00 for screen$).
;   Bytes $03-$04: Start of code block/screen$ ($4000 for screen$).
;   Bytes $05-$06: Offset to the variables (i.e. length of program) if a program. For an array, $05 holds the variable name.
;   Bytes $07-$08: Auto-run line number for a program ($80 in high byte if no auto-run).

; of the SWAP routine as follows, but this is larger than the existing routine and so cannot simply be

; the SWAP routine in the ZX Printer buffer and direct control to the replacement routine held somewhere
; else in RAM. Credit: Toni Baker, ZX Computing Monthly]

; RS232 Output Routine
; --------------------
; This routine handles control codes, token expansion, graphics and UDGs. It therefore cannot send binary data and hence cannot support
; EPSON format ESC control codes [Credit: Andrew Owen].
; The routine suffers from a number of bugs as described in the comments below. It also suffers from a minor flaw in the design, which prevents
; interlacing screen and printer control codes and their parameters. For example, the following will not work correctly:
;
; 10 LPRINT CHR$ 16;
; 20 PRINT AT 0,0;
; 30 LPRINT CHR$ 0;"ABC"
;
; The control byte 16 gets stored in TVDATA so that the system knows how to interpret its parameter byte. However, the AT control code 22
; in line 20 will overwrite it. When line 30 is executed, TVDATA still holds the control code for 'AT' and so this line is interpreted as
; PRINT AT instead of PRINT INK. [Credit: Ian Collier (+3)]
;
; Entry: A=character to output.
; Exit : Carry flag reset indicates success.

; PLAY COMMAND ROUTINES
; =====================
; Up to 3 channels of music/noise are supported by the AY-3-8912 sound generator.
; Up to 8 channels of music can be sent to support synthesisers, drum machines or sequencers via the MIDI interface,
; with the first 3 channels also played by the AY-3-8912 sound generator. For each channel of music, a MIDI channel
; can be assigned to it using the 'Y' command.
;
; The PLAY command reserves and initialises space for the PLAY command. This comprises a block of $003C bytes
; used to manage the PLAY command (IY points to this command data block) and a block of $0037 bytes for each
; channel string (IX is used to point to the channel data block for the current channel). [Note that the command
; data block is $04 bytes larger than it needs to be, and each channel data block is $11 bytes larger than it
; needs to be]
;
; Entry: B=The number of strings in the PLAY command (1..8).

; IY+$23 / IY+$24 = Address of the channel data block pointers, or address of the channel data block duration pointers

; [*BUG* - At this point interrupts are disabled and IY is now being used as a pointer to the master
;          PLAY information block. Unfortunately, interrupts are enabled during the STK_FETCH call and
;          IY is left containing the wrong value. This means that if an interrupt were to occur during
;          execution of the subroutine then there would be a one in 65536 chance that (IY+$40) will be
;          corrupted - this corresponds to the volume setting for music channel A.
;          Rewriting the SWAP routine to only re-enable interrupts if they were originally enabled
;          would cure this bug (see end of file for description of her suggested fix). Credit: Toni Baker, ZX Computing Monthly]

;note delay. This delay length is then subtracted from all channel note lengths to leave the remaining lengths that
;each note needs to be played for. For the channel with the smallest note length, this will now have completely played
;and so a new note is fetched for it. The smallest length of the current notes is then determined again and the process

;          occurs to various sound generator registers, causing spurious sound output. There is in fact no need for this routine
;          to set the volume for any channels since this is done every time a new note is played - see routine at $0A97 (ROM 0).

; for MIDI channels is set to 15 rather than just filtered out. However, the three sound chip channels can also drive three MIDI
; channels and so it would be inconsistent for these MIDI channels to have their volume set to 15 but have the other MIDI channels
; behave differently. However, it could be argued that all MIDI channels should be unaffected by the 'U' command.

;The current channel uses the smallest found duration length

; [A note has been completed and so the channel volume is set to 0 prior to the next note being played.
; This occurs on both sound chip channels and MIDI channels. When a MIDI channel is assigned to more than
; one play string and a rest is used in one of those strings. As soon as the end of the rest period is
; encountered, the channel's volume is set to off even though one of the other play strings controlling
; the MIDI channel may still be playing. This can be seen using the command PLAY "Y1a&", "Y1N9a". Here,
; string 1 starts playing 'a' for the period of a crotchet (1/4 of a note), where as string 2 starts playing
; 'a' for nine periods of a crotchet (9/4 of a note). When string 1 completes its crotchet, it requests
; to play a period of silence via the rest '&'. This turns the volume of the MIDI channel off even though
; string 2 is still timing its way through its nine crotchets. The play command will therefore continue for
; a further seven crotchets but in silence. This is because the volume for note is set only at its start
; and no coordination occurs between strings to turn the volume back on for the second string. It is arguably
; what the correct behaviour should be in such a circumstance where the strings are providing conflicting instructions,
; but having the latest command or note take precedence seems a logical approach. Credit: Ian Collier (+3), Paul Farrow (128)]

; [*BUG* - By this point, the volume for both sound chip and MIDI channels has been set to 0, i.e. off. So although the new notes have been
;          set playing on the sound chip channels, no sound is audible. For MIDI channels, no new notes have yet been output and hence these
;          are also silent. If the time from turning the volume off for the current note to the time to turn the volume on for the next note
;          is short enough, then it will not be noticeable. However, the code at $1066 (ROM 0) introduces a 1/96th of a note delay and as a result a
;          1/96th of a note period of silence between notes. The bug can be resolved by simply deleting the two instructions below that introduce
;          the delay. A positive side effect of the bug in the 'V' volume command at $0C95 (ROM 0) is that it can be used to overcome the gaps of silence
;          between notes for sound chip channels. By interspersing volume commands between notes, a new volume level is immediately set before
;          the 1/96th of a note delay is introduced for the new note. Therefore, the delay occurs when the new note is audible instead of when it
;          is silent. For example, PLAY "cV15cV15c" instead of PLAY "ccc". The note durations are still 1/96th of a note longer than they should
;          be though. This technique will only work on the sound chip channels and not for any MIDI channels. Credit: Ian Collier (+3), Paul Farrow (128)]

;There are editable characters on this row prior to the cursor

; [*BUG* - Entering '  10 REM' or '0010 REM' will insert the line into the program area but instead of placing the cursor on the following row it is placed after the following
;          BASIC line, or if the line inserted was the last in the program then the cursor is placed on row 20. The bug occurs due to the leading spaces or zeros, and hence will apply
;          to every BASIC command. When the line is inserted into the Screen Line Edit Buffer, the leading spaces are discarded and hence the line length is shorter than that typed
;          in. However, it is the typed in line length that is used when parsing the BASIC line in the Screen Line Edit Buffer and as a result this causes an
;          attempt to find the remaining characters on the following row of the Screen Line Edit Buffer. If another BASIC line is on the following Screen Line Edit Buffer
;          row then the search completes and the cursor is placed on the row after this BASIC line. If there is not a BASIC line on the following
;          row then the search continues on the next row. Since this will also be empty, the search advances onto the next row, and then the next, and so
;          on until row 20 is reached. To fix the bug, the typed in character count until the cursor (held in $EC06) ideally needs to be adjusted to match the actual number of characters stored
;          in the Screen Line Edit Buffer. However, this is not a trivial change to implement. A simpler solution to fix the bug is to intercept when a move to the next row is made and
;          to determine whether the BASIC line actually continues on this row. Credit: Paul Farrow]

; (From Logan & O'Hara's 48K ROM disassembly):
; The requirements for the different command classes are as follows:
; CLASS-00 - No further operands.
; CLASS-01 - Used in LET. A variable is required.
; CLASS-02 - Used in LET. An expression, numeric or string, must follow.
; CLASS-03 - A numeric expression may follow. Zero to be used in case of default.
; CLASS-04 - A single character variable must follow.
; CLASS-05 - A set of items may be given.
; CLASS-06 - A numeric expression must follow.
; CLASS-07 - Handles colour items.
; CLASS-08 - Two numeric expressions, separated by a comma, must follow.
; CLASS-09 - As for CLASS-08 but colour items may precede the expressions.
; CLASS-0A - A string expression must follow.
; CLASS-0B - Handles cassette/RAM disk routines.

; In addition the 128 adds the following classes:
; CLASS-0C - Like class 00 but calling ROM 0. (Used by SPECTRUM, MOVE, COPY, NEW, GO SUB, RETURN)
; CLASS-0D - Like class 06 but calling ROM 0. (Used by CLEAR, RUN)
; CLASS-0E - Handled in ROM 0. (Used by PLAY, ERASE, CAT, FORMAT, CIRCLE, LPRINT, LLIST, DRAW, DATA, READ, LIST, DIM, INPUT, PRINT, FOR, IF)

; cause garbage to the printed, i.e. the paging routines and new system variables still present in the ZX Printer buffer.
; Subsequently printer output will then be ok since the ZX Printer buffer and system variables will be cleared.
; Worse still, there is the possibility that new data to be printed will be inserted beyond the ZX Printer buffer since
; ROM 1 does not trap whether the ZX Printer system variable PR_POSN and PR_CC hold invalid values. The bug can be fixed
; by inserting the following instructions, which cause the ZX Printer buffer to be cleared immediately after switching to
; ROM 1 and before the error report "0 OK" is produced. Credit: Paul Farrow and Andrew Owen.]

; ------------------
; Produce Error Beep
; ------------------
; This is the entry point to produce the error beep, e.g. when trying to cursor up or down past the BASIC program.
; It produces a different tone and duration from the error beep of 48K mode. The change is pitch is due to the SRL A
; instruction at $26EA (ROM 0), and the change in duration is due to the instruction at $26F1 (ROM 0) which loads HL with $0C80 as opposed
; to $1A90 which is used when in 48K mode. The key click and key repeat sounds are produced by entering at $26EC (ROM 0) but with A
; holding the value of system variable PIP. This produces the same tone as 48K mode but is of a much longer duration due to
; HL being loaded with $0C80 as opposed to the value of $00C8 used in 48K mode. The Spanish 128 uses the same key click tone
; and duration in 128K mode as it does in 48K mode, leading to speculation that the Spectrum 128 (and subsequent models) should
; have done the same and hence suffer from a bug. However, there is no reason why this should be the case, and it can easily be
; imagined that the error beep note duration of 48K mode would quickly become very irritating when in 128K mode where it is likely
; to occur far more often. Hence the reason for its shorter duration. The reason for the longer key click is less clear, unless it
; was to save memory by using a single routine. However, it would only have required an additional 3 bytes to set HL independently
; for key clicks, which is not a great deal considering there is 1/2K of unused routines at $2336 (ROM 0). Since the
; INPUT command is handled by ROM 1, it produces key clicks at the 48K mode duration even when executed from 128 BASIC mode.

; [*BUG* - When moving the cursor up or down, an attempt is made to place the cursor at the same column position that it had on the previous row (the preferred column).
;          If this is not possible then the cursor is placed at the end of the row. However, it is the intention that the preferred column is still remembered
;          and hence an attempt is made to place the cursor at this column whenever it is subsequently moved. However, a bug at this point in the ROM causes
;          the preferred column position for the cursor to be overwritten with random data. If the cursor was moved from its original position
;          into its error position then the preferred column gets set to zero and the next up or down cursor movement will cause the cursor marker
;          to jump to the left-hand side of the screen. However, if the cursor remained in the same position then the preferred column gets set to
;          a random value and so on the next up or down cursor movement the cursor marker can jump to a random position on the screen. The bug can
;          can reproduced by typing a line that is just longer than one row, pressing enter twice and then cursor down. The cursor marker will probably
;          jump somewhere in the middle of the screen. Press an arrow again and the computer may even crash. Credit: Ian Collier (+3), Andrew Owen (128)]

;          delete it, and then cursor up or down onto a program line. The line is considered to have been changed and so is processed as if it consists
;          of characters. Further, when cursor down is pressed to move to a BASIC line below, that line is deemed to have changed and hence moving off from it
;          causing that line to be re-inserted into the BASIC program. Credit: Ian Collier (+3), Paul Farrow (128)]

; [*BUG* - HL points to the start of the first row of the Above-Screen Line Edit Buffer but it should point to the settings fields
;          3 bytes earlier since the call to $32D6 (ROM 0) will advance HL by 3 bytes.
;          The bug manifests itself when modifying a BASIC line that spans off the top of the screen. It causes corruption
;          to the line number, causing a new BASIC line to be inserted rather than updating the line being edited. When editing lines with
;          a high line number, the corrupted line number can end up larger 9999 and hence the line is deemed invalid when Enter is pressed
;          to insert the line into the BASIC program. The effects of the bug are often masked by the bug at $2DA1 (ROM 0) which performs LD HL,($F9DB)
;          instead of LD HL,$F9DB and thereby fails to detect when the end of the Above-Screen Line Edit Buffer has been reached. The bug can
;          be fixed by inserted three DEC HL instructions before the call to $32D6 (ROM 0). Credit: Paul Farrow]

; ===================
; TAPE TESTER ROUTINE
; ===================

; The Tape Tester routine displays a bright blue bar completely across row 8,
; with 6 black markers evenly distributed above it on row 7 (columns 1, 7, 13,
; 19, 25 and 31). The tape port is read 2048 times and the number of highs/lows
; counted. A cyan marker is placed on the blue bar to indicate the ratio of high
; and lows. The higher the tape player volume, the further to the right the cyan
; marker will appear. The Tape Tester can be exited by pressing BREAK (though only
; SPACE checked), ENTER or EDIT (though only key 1 checked). Note that no attempt
; to read the keypad is made and so it cannot be used to exit the Tape Tester.
;
; Although the Sinclair manual suggests setting the tape player volume such that
; the cyan marker appears as far to the right of the screen as possible, this does
; not guarantee the best possible loading volume. Instead, it appears better to
; aim for the cyan marker appearing somewhere near the mid point of the blue bar.
;
; There are bugs in the Tape Tester code that can cause the cyan level marker to
; spill over onto the first column of the row below. This is most likely to occur
; when the Tape Tester is selected whilst a tape is already playing. The routine
; initially reads the state of the tape input and assumes this represents silence.
; It then monitors the tape input for 2048 samples and counts how many high levels
; appear on the tape input. Should this initial reading of the tape port not
; correspond to silence then when a true period of silence does occur it will be
; interpreted as continuous noise and hence a maximum sample count. It is a maximum
; sample count that leads to the cyan marker spilling onto the next row.

; ========================
; EDITOR ROUTINES - PART 5
; ========================

; -------------------
; Tokenize BASIC Line
; -------------------
; This routine serves two purposes. The first is to tokenize a typed BASIC line into a tokenized version. The second is when a syntax error is subsequently
; detected within the tokenized line, and it is then used to search for the position within the typed line where the error marker should be shown.
;
; This routine parses the BASIC line entered by the user and generates a tokenized version in the workspace area as pointed to by system variable E_LINE.
; It suffers from a number of bugs related to the handling of '>' and '<' characters. The keywords '<>', '>=' and '<=' are the only keywords that
; do not commence with letters and the routine traps these in a different manner to all other keywords. If a '<' or '>' is encountered then it is not
; immediately copied to the BASIC line workspace since the subsequent character must be examined as it could be a '>' or '=' character and therefore
; might form the keywords '<>', '>=' or '<='. A problem occurs if the subsequent character is a letter since the parser now expects the start of a
; possible keyword. It should at this point insert the '<' or '>' into the BASIC line workspace but neglects to do this. It is only when the next non-letter
; character is encountered that the '<' or '>' gets inserted, but this is now after the previously found string has been inserted. This results the following
; types of errors:
;
; 'PRINT varA>varB' is seen by the parser as 'PRINT varAvarB>' and hence a syntax error occurs.
; 'PRINT varA>varB1' is seen by the parser as 'PRINT varAvarB>1' and hence is accepted as a valid statement.
;
; A work-around is to follow the '<' or '>' with a space since this forces the '<' or '>' to be inserted before the next potential keyword is examined.
;
; A consequence of shifting a '<' or '>' is that a line such as 'PRINT a$>b$' is seen by the parser as 'PRINT a$b$>' and so it throws a syntax error.
; The parser saved the '>' character for consideration when the next character was examined to see if it was part of the keywords '<>', '>=' or '<=',
; but fails to discard it if the end of the statement is immediately encountered. Modifying the statement to a form that will be accepted will still cause
; a syntax error since the parser mistakenly believes the '>' character applies to this statement.
;
; The parser identifies string literals contained within quotes and will not tokenize any keywords that appear inside them, except for the keywords "<>",
; "<=" and ">=" which it neglects to check for. Keywords are also not tokenized following a REM statement, except again for "<>", "<=" and ">=", until the
; end of the line is reached. This differs slightly to 48K BASIC mode. In 48K BASIC mode, typing a ':' following a REM statement will cause a change from
; 'L' cursor mode to 'K' cursor mode and hence the next key press results in a keyword token being inserted. In 128K BASIC mode, typing a ':' will not change
; to 'K' cursor mode and hence the next key press will just be the letter, number or symbol. This does not affect the running of the program since 48K BASIC
; mode will ignore all characters after a REM command until the end of the line. However, creating such a REM statement in 128K BASIC mode that appears similar
; to one created in 48K BASIC mode will result in more memory being used since the 'keyword' must be spelled out letter by letter.
;
; When being used to locate the error marker position, the same process is performed as when tokenizing but no characters are actually inserted into the workspace
; (they are still there from when the line was originally tokenized). Instead, a check is made after each character is processed to see if the error marker address
; held in system variable X_PTR has been reached. If it does match then the routine returns with BC holding the character position where the error marker should
; be displayed at.

;          a colon returns the cursor into 'K' mode and hence the next key press inserts a keyword token. In 128K mode, typing a colon
;          does not cause the characters following it to be interpreted as a possible keyword. There is no noticeable difference when
;          executing the REM statement since subsequent statements are ignored following a REM command. However, for consistency the

; Insert a Character into BASIC Line Workspace
; --------------------------------------------
; This routine is called for two purposes. The first use is for inserting a character or token into the BASIC line workspace (situated at E_LINE).
; The second use is after a syntax error has been identified within the tokenized BASIC line in the workspace and the location of the error marker needs to be
; established. For the second case, the system variable X_PTR holds the address of where the error occurred within the tokenized BASIC line in the workspace.
; The Editor needs to identify how many characters there are before the equivalent error position is reached within the typed BASIC line. To locate it, the typed BASIC
; line is re-parsed but this time without inserting any characters into the BASIC line workspace, since this still contains the tokenized line from before. This tokenized line
; will now also include embedded floating point numbers for any numeric literals contained within the BASIC line. As the typed line is re-parsed, a count of the characters
; examined so far is kept and instead of inserting tokenized characters within the BASIC line workspace, a check is made to see whether the insertion location has
; reached the address of the error marker. If it has then the parsing of the BASIC line terminates and the count of the typed line characters indicates the equivalent
; position within it of the error. However, should the last character have been a token then the typed line count will also include the number of characters that form
; the keyword, and so this must be subtracted from the count.

;Searching for the error marker so need to consider embedded floating point numbers

; [*BUG* - This should fetch the next character from the tokenized BASIC line and not the current character. This routine
;          is called to process every visible character in the BASIC line, but is not called for embedded floating point numbers.
;          It must therefore test whether the current character is followed by an embedded floating point number and if so to skip
;          over it. The routine does make an attempt to detect embedded floating point numbers but incorrectly performs the test
;          on the visible character and not the character that follows it. The bug can be fixed as replacing the LD A,(HL) instruction

; ===========================
; Standard Error Report Codes
; ===========================

; 0 - OK                      Successful completion, or jump to a line number bigger than any existing.
; 1 - NEXT without FOR        The control variable does not exist (it has not been set up by a FOR statement),
;                             but there is an ordinary variable with the same name.
; 2 - Variable not found      For a simple variable, this will happen if the variable is used before it has been assigned
;                             to by a LET, READ or INPUT statement, loaded from disk (or tape), or set up in a FOR statement.
;                             For a subscripted variable, it will happen if the variable is used before it has been
;                             dimensioned in a DIM statement, or loaded from disk (or tape).
; 3 - Subscript wrong         A subscript is beyond the dimension of the array or there are the wrong number of subscripts.
; 4 - Out of memory           There is not enough room in the computer for what you are trying to do.
; 5 - Out of screen           An INPUT statement has tried to generate more than 23 lines in the lower half of the screen.
;                             Also occurs with 'PRINT AT 22,xx'.
; 6 - Number too big          Calculations have yielded a number greater than approximately 10^38.
; 7 - RETURN without GO SUB   There has been one more RETURN than there were GO SUBs.
; 8 - End of file             Input returned unacceptable character code.
; 9 - STOP statement          After this, CONTINUE will not repeat the STOP but carries on with the statement after.
; A - Invalid argument        The argument for a function is unsuitable.
; B - Integer out of range    When an integer is required, the floating point argument is rounded to the nearest integer.
;                             If this is outside a suitable range, then this error results.
; C - Nonsense in BASIC       The text of the (string) argument does not form a valid expression.
; D - BREAK - CONT repeats    BREAK was pressed during some peripheral operation.
; E - Out of DATA             You have tried to READ past the end of the DATA list.
; F - Invalid file name       SAVE with filename empty or longer than 10 characters.
; G - No room for line        There is not enough room left in memory to accommodate the new program line.
; H - STOP in INPUT           Some INPUT data started with STOP.
; I - FOR without NEXT        A FOR loop was to be executed no times (e.g. FOR n=1 TO 0) and corresponding NEXT statement could not be found.
; J - Invalid I/O device      Attempting to input characters from or output characters to a device that doesn't support it.
; K - Invalid colour          The number specified is not an appropriate value.
; L - BREAK into program      BREAK pressed. This is detected between two statements.
; M - RAMTOP no good          The number specified for RAMTOP is either too big or too small.
; N - Statement lost          Jump to a statement that no longer exists.
; O - Invalid Stream          Trying to input from or output to a stream that isn't open or that is out of range (0...15),
;                             or trying to open a stream that is out of range.
; P - FN without DEF          User-defined function used without a corresponding DEF in the program.
; Q - Parameter error         Wrong number of arguments, or one of them is the wrong type.
; R - Tape loading error      A file on tape was found but for some reason could not be read in, or would not verify.

; ==========
; I Register
; ==========
; The I register is used along with the R register by the Z80 for automatic memory refreshing. Setting the I register to a value between $40 and $7F
; causes memory refreshes to occur to the lower 16K RAM. This RAM is contended with the ULA which uses it for the generation of the video display.
; The memory refreshes get interpreted by the ULA as the CPU requesting to access the lower 16K RAM bank very rapidly and very often. The ULA is not
; able to handle reads at such a high frequency, with the consequence that it fails to fetch and output the next screen byte. Instead it uses re-uses
; the byte previously read. This causes a visible corruption to the video display output, often referred to a 'snow', although no actual corruption
; occurs to the video display RAM. This also happens when the I register is set to a value between $C0 and $FF when a contended RAM bank is paged in
; and, unlike the Spectrum 16K/48K, can lead to a machine crash.


; ===================
; Screen File Formats
; ===================
; The two screens available on the Spectrum 128, the normal screen in RAM bank 5 ($4000-$5AFF) and the shadow screen in
; RAM bank 7 ($C000-$FFFF), both use the same file format.
;
; ------------
; Display File
; ------------
; The display file consists of 3 areas, each consisting of 8 characters rows, with each row consisting of 8 pixel lines.
; Each pixel line consists of 32 cell columns, with each cell consisting of a byte that represents 8 pixels.
;
; The address of a particular cell is formed as follows:
;
;      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
;      | s | 1 | 0 | a | a | l | l | l |  | r | r | r | c | c | c | c | c |
;      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
; Bit:  15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8      7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
;
; where: s     = Screen (0-1: 0=Normal screen, 1=Shadow Screen)
;        aa    = Area   (0-2)
;        rrr   = Row    (0-7)
;        lll   = Line   (0-7)
;        ccccc = Column (0-31)
;
; An area value of 3 denotes the attributes file, which consists of a different format.
;
; ---------------
; Attributes File
; ---------------
; The attributes file consists of 24 characters rows, with each row consisting of 32 cell columns.
; Each cell consisting of a byte that holds the colour information.
;
; The address of a particular cell is formed as follows:
;
;      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
;      | s | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | r | r |  | r | r | r | c | c | c | c | c |
;      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+  +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
; Bit:  15  14  13  12  11  10   9   8      7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
;
; where: s     = Screen (0-1: 0=Normal screen, 1=Shadow Screen) 
;        rrrrr = Row    (0-23)
;        ccccc = Column (0-31)
;
;
; Each cell holds a byte of colour information:
;
;      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
;      | f | b | p | p | p | i | i | i |
;      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
; Bit:   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
;
; where: f   = Flash  (0-1: 0=Off, 1=On)
;        b   = Bright (0-1: 0=Off, 1=On)
;        ppp = Paper  (0-7: 0=Black, 1=Blue, 2=Red, 3=Magenta, 4=Green, 5=Cyan, 6=Yellow, 7=White)
;        iii = Ink    (0-7: 0=Black, 1=Blue, 2=Red, 3=Magenta, 4=Green, 5=Cyan, 6=Yellow, 7=White)
;
; -----------------------------------------------------------
; Address Conversion Between Display File and Attributes File
; -----------------------------------------------------------
; The address of the attribute cell corresponding to an address in the display file can be constructed by moving bits 11 to 12 (the area value)
; to bit positions 8 to 9, setting bit 10 to 0 and setting bits 11 to 12 to 1.
;
; The address of the display file character cell corresponding to an address in the attributes file can be constructed by moving bits 8 to 9 (the row value)
; to bit positions 11 to 12, and then setting bits 8 to 9 to 0.
 

; ==================
; Standard I/O Ports
; ==================

; --------
; Port $FE
; --------
; This controls the cassette interface, the speaker, the border colour and is used to read the keyboard.
; Since it is the ULA that controls these facilities, it will introduce a delay when accessing the port if
; it is busy at the time, and hence I/O port $FE is subject to contention.
;
; OUTPUT:
;
; Bit 0-2: Border colour  (0=Black, 1=Blue, 2=Red, 3=Magenta, 4=Green, 5=Cyan, 6=Yellow, 7=White).
; Bit 3  : MIC output     (1=Off, 0=On).
; Bit 4  : Speaker output (1=On, 0=Off).

; ======================
; Cassette Header Format
; ======================
;
; A file consists of a header block followed by a data block. Each block begins with a flag that
; indicates whether it is a header block or a data block. Next are the header or data bytes,
; and finally a checksum of the flag and header/data bytes.
;
; Flag     - A value of $00 for a header and $FF for a data block.
; Bytes    - The bytes forming the header information or the file data.
; Checksum - An XOR checksum of the Flag and Bytes fields.
;
; The header information consists of 17 bytes and these describe the size and type of data that the
; data block contains.
;
; The header bytes have the following meaning:
;   Byte  $00    : File type - $00=Program, $01=Numeric array, $02=Character array, $03=Code/Screen$.
;   Bytes $01-$0A: File name, padding with trailing spaces.
;   Bytes $0B-$0C: Length of program/code block/screen$/array ($1B00 for screen$).
;   Bytes $0D-$0E: For a program, it holds the auto-run line number ($80 in byte $0E if no auto-run).
;                  For code block/screen$ it holds the start address ($4000 for screen$).
;                  For an array, it holds the variable name in byte $0E.
;   Bytes $0F-$10: Offset to the variables (i.e. length of program) if a program.


; ================================================
; AY-3-8912 Programmable Sound Generator Registers
; ================================================
; This is controlled through output I/O port $FFFD. It is driven from a 1.77345 MHz clock.
; The datasheet for the AY-3-8912 lists to the registers in octal, but below they are listed in decimal.
;
; -----------------
; Registers 0 and 1 (Channel A Tone Generator)
; -----------------
; Forms a 12 bit pitch control for sound channel A. The basic unit of tone is the clock
; frequency divided by 16, i.e. 110.841 kHz. With a 12 bit counter range, 4095 different
; frequencies from 27.067 Hz to 110.841 kHz (in increments of 27.067 Hz) can be generated.
;
;   Bits 0-7  : Contents of register 0.
;   Bits 8-11 : Contents of lower nibble of register 1.
;   Bits 12-15: Not used.
;
; -----------------

; -----------------
; Forms a 12 bit pitch control for sound channel B.
;
;   Bits 0-7  : Contents of register 2.
;   Bits 8-11 : Contents of lower nibble of register 3.
;   Bits 12-15: Not used.
;
; -----------------
; Registers 4 and 5 (Channel C Tone Generator)
; -----------------
; Forms a 12 bit pitch control for sound channel C.
;
;   Bits 0-7  : Contents of register 4.
;   Bits 8-11 : Contents of lower nibble of register 5.
;   Bits 12-15: Not used.
;
; ----------
; Register 6 (Noise Generator)
; ----------
; The frequency of the noise is obtained in the PSG by first counting down the input
; clock by 16 (i.e. 110.841 kHz), then by further counting down the result by the programmed
; 5 bit noise period value held in bits 0-4 of register 6. With a 5 bit counter range, 31 different
; frequencies from 3.576 kHz to 110.841 kHz (in increments of 3.576 kHz) can be generated.
;
; ----------
; Register 7 (Mixer - I/O Enable)
; ----------
; This controls the enable status of the noise and tone mixers for the three channels,
; and also controls the I/O port used to drive the RS232 and Keypad sockets.
;
; Bit 0: Channel A Tone Enable (0=enabled).
; Bit 1: Channel B Tone Enable (0=enabled).
; Bit 2: Channel C Tone Enable (0=enabled).
; Bit 3: Channel A Noise Enable (0=enabled).
; Bit 4: Channel B Noise Enable (0=enabled).
; Bit 5: Channel C Noise Enable (0=enabled).

; Bits 6-7: Not used.
;
; -----------
; Register 10 (Channel C Volume)
; -----------
; This controls the volume of channel C.
;
; Bits 0-4: Channel C volume level.
; Bit 5   : 1=Use envelope defined by register 13 and ignore the volume setting.
; Bits 6-7: Not used.
;
; ------------------
; Register 11 and 12 (Envelope Period)
; ------------------
; These registers allow the frequency of the envelope to be selected.
; The frequency of the envelope is obtained in the PSG by first counting down
; the input clock by 256 (6.927 kHz), then further counting down the result by the programmed
; 16 bit envelope period value. With a 16 bit counter range, 65535 different
; frequencies from 1.691 Hz to 110.841 kHz (in increments of 1.691 Hz) can be generated.
;
; Bits 0-7 : Contents of register 11.
; Bits 8-15: Contents of register 12.
;
; -----------
; Register 13 (Envelope Shape)
; -----------
; This register allows the shape of the envelope to be selected.
; The envelope generator further counts down the envelope frequency by 16, producing
; a 16-state per cycle envelope pattern. The particular shape and cycle pattern of any
; desired envelope is accomplished by controlling the count pattern of the 4 bit counter
; and by defining a single cycle or repeat cycle pattern.
;
; Bit 0   : Hold.
; Bit 1   : Alternate.
; Bit 2   : Attack.
; Bit 3   : Continue.
; Bits 4-7: Not used.
