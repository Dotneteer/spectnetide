# CHAPTER 22: Other Equipment

There is other equipment that you will be able to attach to the Spectrum.

The **ZX Microdrive** is a high speed mass storage device, and is much more flexible in the way it can be used than a cassette recorder. It will operate not
only with **SAVE**, **VERIFY**, **LOAD** and **MERGE**, but also with **PRINT**, **LIST**, **INPUT** and **INKEY$**.

The **network** is used for connecting several Spectrums so that they can talk to each other - one of the uses of this is that you then need only one
Microdrive to serve several computers.
 
The **RS232 interface** is a standard connection that allows you to link a Spectrum with keyboards, printers, computers and various other machines even if
they were not designed specifically for the Spectrum.

These will use some extra keywords that are on the keyboard, but cannot be used without the extra attachments: they are **OPEN #**, **CLOSE #**, **MOV**, **ERASE**, **CAT** and **FORMAT**.
