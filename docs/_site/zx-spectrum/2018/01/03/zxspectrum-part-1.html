              <p>One morning in January 2017, I woke up with the idea of creating a ZX Spectrum emulator. I did not remember that I had dreamed of anything special, but still as I got out of bed, that was the first thought wedged in my mind.</p>

<p>As an agile coach and architect, I spend most of my time with small teams that intend to shift to agile software development. I always look for new ideas and approaches to demonstrate the importance of automatic testing.</p>

<p>That January morning had me recognized that writing an emulator software offers tremendous opportunities in this field.</p>

<p>In my childhood, when I was 15, ZX Spectrum was my second microcomputer—I had had a ZX 81 for seven months before. After school and gymnastic training, I spent almost all of my free time to program in BASIC and Z80 assembly.</p>

<p>Probably that very morning my brain linked my wish for automatic testing scenarios and the joy of my ZX Spectrum past into a viable idea. Nonetheless, I felt happy and full of energy.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/zx-spectrum/PacManInAction.png" alt="pacman" /></p>

<p>I knew that there are dozens of ZX Spectrum emulators for free. I did not want to create a new one because I thought mine would be better or faster. I intended to build one that helps me in my work and allows the community to learn from it. I envisaged a fun project that creates the best documented ZX Spectrum emulator that software enthusiasts can use as a reference for their custom implementations.</p>

<p>I am a Microsoft MVP (Visual Studio and Development Tools) and a Microsoft Regional Director and use the .NET Framework and .NET Core heavily. Thus, I decided to implement the software in C#. As I was thinking of what other value I can give the community, I got the idea to create not only an emulator but also a development environment that is integrated with the Visual Studio IDE.</p>

<p>As of this writing, a few days more than one year went away. My pet project, <a href="https://github.com/Dotneteer/spectnetide">SpectNetIde</a>, as I name it, become fun and a great tool at the same time. I’m not only enjoying improving it, but at the same time I learn a lot from it and use it in my customer teams to demonstrate software design and testing principles.</p>

<p>I decided to share my experiences on this blog. Stay tuned!</p>
