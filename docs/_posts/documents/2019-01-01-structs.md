__SpectNetIDE__ allows you to use structure definitions and placements in your Z80 programs. If you know the `struct` construct from C, C++, or C#, the concept in Z80 is only partly similar.

## Understanding Structures

In __SpectNetIDE__ assembler, a structure definition is a placeholder that defines a byte pattern like this:

```
Object2D: .struct
    .defw 0
    .defw 0
    .defb 1
    .defb 1
  .ends
```

This definition says that `Object2D` is a structure of six bytes (two 16-bit words and two 8-bit bytes) with the following bytes emitted: #00, #00, #00, #00, #01, #01. Whenever you place a structure declaration in a program, just like in this sample, the assembler will emit the bytes you specified in the `.struct` definition:

```
  Object2D() ; emits #00, #00, #00, #00, #01, #01
```

As you can see, a set of six subsequent bytes do not tell enough about the semantics of `Object2D`. When we created this structure, the original concept was to use two 16-bit numbers to specify the X and Y coordinates of the object, plus two 8-bit numbers to describe its horizontal and vertical velocity. With _field definitions_ (see `X`, `Y`, `DX`, and `DY`), the meaning of `Object2D` is more straightforward than it was before:

```
Object2D: .struct
    X: .defw 0
    Y: .defw 0
    DX: .defb 1
    DY: .defb 1
  .ends
```

Of course, we would like to initialize objects with different states. With _field initializers_, we can define structures with initial states that are different from the `.struct` definition:

```
Apple: Object2D()
  X -> .defw 100
  Y -> .defw 100

Pear: Object2D()
  DX -> .defb -1
  DY -> .defb -1
  ; Some other code
  ; ...
  ld hl,Apple
  ld de,Pear
```

In this sample, the `Apple` label (that the code later loads into __HL__) points to an `Object2D` declaration that holds 100 in its X and Y values. Another label, `Pear` points to a different instance of `Object2D` (later the code loads that address into __DE__). `Pear` has a converse velocity compared to `Apple`.

The __SpecNetIDE__ assembler allows you initialize structures with any pragma that emit bytes to the assembly output. For example, the following code snippet sets a new `Object2D` structure in a particular way:

```
Banana: Object2D()
  -> .defb 10, 1
  -> .defb 12, 2
  DX -> .defb 2, 2
```

The first `.defb` pragma (right after the first `->`) emits two bytes, 10, and 1, respectively -- it sets the X field to 266 (10 + 1*256). The second `.defb` sets Y to 524 (12 * 2*256). The initialization of DX (`DX -> .defb 2, 2`) emits two bytes and sets both `DX` and `DY` to 2.

## Structure Definition

You can place a structure definition between the `.struct` and `.ends`  statements. Each structure must have a unique name that you can declare with a label. The compiler accepts all of these definitions:

```
; Version #1
MyStruct .struct
  ; ...
  .ends

; Version #2
MyStruct: .struct
  ; ...
  .ends


; Version #3
MyStruct
  .struct
  ; ...
  .ends

; Version#4
MyStruct:
  .struct
  ; ...
  .ends
```

Nonetheless, it raises an error if you do not name the structure:

```
.struct ; ERROR: .struct must have a name
; ...
.ends
```

> __Note__: The assembler accepts the following alternative keywords for `.struct`: `.STRUCT`, `struct`, or `STRUCT`. Similarly, `.ends` has these aliases, too: `.ENDS`, `ends`, `ENDS`. Though you can define an empty structure, there is no practical reason to do so.

In the body of the structure, you can use only one of these byte-emitter pragmas: `.defb`, `.defw`, `.defm`, `.defn`, `.defc`, `.defs`, `.fillb`, `.fillw`, `.defg`,  or `.defgx`. If you try to use any other construct, the compiler raises an error message.

As you saw earlier, you can specify field labels within the structure body. The assembler is flexible: you can omit field labels, or even use multiple labels for a single field:

```
Object2D_A: .struct
  Coords:
    X: .defw 0
    Y: .defw 0
  Velocity:
    .defb 1
    .defb 1
  .ends
```

Here, `Object2D_A` has two field name for the first `.defw` field, `Coords`, and `X`, respectively. The last `.defb` does not have its own field name, unlike the one before, `Velocity`.


## Labels and Field Names

The label assigned to the `.struct` definition has a dual role. When used in a structure initialization (for example, as `Object2D` is utilized in the `Object2D()` initializer, it identifies the structure. Nonetheless, you can use the label name in Z80 instructions, too. In this case, the label's value is the size of the structure. For example, these instructions are equivalent, as the size of the `Object2D` structure is six bytes:

```
ld a,Object2D ; Size of Object2D
; ...
ld a,6 ; 
```

You can allocate a memory block for 100 uninitialized instances of `Object2D` with this pragma:

```
My100Objects:
  .defs 100 * Object2D
```

> __Note__: You cannot assign a label to the `.ends` statement. If you do, the compiler throws an error.

Labels assigned to the body of the `.struct` definition are used as field names. You can use them only with the structure name:

```
Object2D: .struct
    X: .defw 0
    Y: .defw 0
    DX: .defb 1
    DY: .defb 1
  .ends

Apple: Object2D()
  ; ...
  ld hl,Apple + Object2D.DX
  ld a,(hl)
```

Field label values contain the offset of the particular field from the beginning of the structure. Thus, the last two instructions in the code above load the content of the `Apple` structure's `DX` field into __A__.

According to this definitions, here are the field label values of `Object2D`:

```
Object2D.X: 0
Object2D.Y: 2
Object2D.DX: 4
Object2D.DY: 5
```

## Structure initialization

The `.struct` definition does not emit any code, it just tells the compiler the layout and initial contents of a structure. To allocate space for a particular structure, you need to initialize it with the name of the structure plus a pair of opening and closing parentheses, just like these samples show:

```
; Initalize an Object2D
MyObject: Object2D()

; Initialize another one
OtherObject: Object2D()
```

When you add a label to the structure initialization, that label's value points to the beginning of the structure in the memory.

```
start: .org #8000

DistanceEntry:
  .struct
    Address: .defw $
    SeqNo: .defb Index
  .ends


Data: .org #9000
Index = 1;
Entry1:	DistanceEntry()
Index = 2;
Entry2:	DistanceEntry()
Index = 3;
Entry3:	DistanceEntry()
```

The compiler emits the initialization code for `Entry1`, `Entry2`, and `Entry3` as if you wrote this:

```
Data .org #9000
Entry1:
  .defw #9000
  .defb 1
Entry2:
  .defw #9003
  .defb 2
Entry3:
  .defw #9006
  .defb 03
```

## Field Initializers

Field initializers can be used to change the default structure initializer. A field initializer has this syntax:

[_identifier_] __`->`__ _byte-emitter-pragma_

For a moment let's forget about the fact that _identifier_ is optional. When you use it, it must be one of the structure's fields names. The _byte-emitter-pragma_ is one of the __SpectNetIDE__ pragmas you can use to define a structure body; namely these:  `.defb`, `.defw`, `.defm`, `.defn`, `.defc`, `.defs`, `.fillb`, `.fillw`, `.defg`,  or `.defgx`.

> __Note__: You can use the label syntax for field names, so you can add an optional colon after the _identifier_.

You can apply field initializer statements right after the structure initialization. Any other Z80 instruction, pragma, statement, directive signs the end of the structure initialization. This code snippet shows two examples of setting up `Object2D` structures. The first is correct, however, the second one raises an error:

```
Object2D: .struct
    X: .defw 0
    Y: .defw 0
    DX: .defb 1
    DY: .defb 1
  .ends

Obj1: Object2D()
  DX -> .defb 2
  DY -> .defb 2
  ld a,b
  ; ... Some other code
Obj2: Object2D()
  X -> .defw 100
  Y -> .defw 100
  ld hl,#4000    ; Field initialization stops here
  DX -> .defb 4  ; ERROR
```

The compiler does not care how you initialize fields. For example, even if you have created the `X` field of `Object2D` with a `.defw` pragma, you can set its value with `.defb`, like in this example:

```
Obj3: Object2D()
  X -> .defb 100, 0
```

You can even initialize two fields with a simple initializer statement. For example, `DX` and `DY` are one byte each. You can initialize both of these fields in a single step, as these code snippet shows:

```
Obj4: Object2D()
  DX -> .defb 2,2

Obj5: Object2D()
  DX -> .defw #0202
```

The order of fields is unimportant, you can initialize them in any order:

```
Obj6: Object2D()
  DX -> .defb 1
  X -> .defw 100
  DY -> .defb 1
  Y -> .defw 200
```

## Fluent Structure Initialization

The assembler allows using flexible initialization, where you do not use field names. The compiler amits bytes as the byte emitter pragmas would do if you were not within a structure initialization. Let's assume, you initialize an `Object2D` this way:

```
Obj7: Object2D()
  -> .defb 1, 0
  DX -> defw #0303
```

Without the field initializers the structure would contain these six bytes:

\#00, #00, #00, #00, #01, #01

However, the field initializers overwrote the default bytes with the ones displayed in boldface:

__#01__, __#00__, #00, #00, __#03__, __#03__

You can choose your preferred way to initialize a structure using field or unnamed initializers. The compiler does not care how you assemble the set of bytes within the structure. However, it does not allow you to overflow the structure boundaries.
This sample shows you two initialization of `Object2D`. The first is correct, as it emits exactly six bytes. However, the second raises an error, since the initialization tries to put eight bytes into the structure:

```
Obj8: Object2D()
  -> .defm "012345"

Obj9: Object2D()    ; ERROR: The code tries to intialize the structure with 8 bytes
  X -> .defw 100
  -> .defm "012345"
```
