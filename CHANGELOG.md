### Version 1.1.1

__This is the first version with tracked changes__

_FEATURE_: Code injection logic has been changed:
  * When the Spectrum VM is stopped, the IDE gives a warning to pause it.
  * When the VM is paused, the IDE injects the code to the VM.
  * When the VM is stopped, the IDE starts the VM, pauses it, and then injects the code.
